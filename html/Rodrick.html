		<p> Growing up, Eirneall was always proud of the fact that he stood above all of his friends over 5 feet tall. In many fashions he was a typical High Elf in appearance. His height and his rich brown hair, however, made him the center of attention. Every kid wanted to be friends with with Eirneall Siannodel, and he knew it. Not only did he enjoy this, but he learned from a young age how to use his gifts. </p>
		<br>
		<p>In Eirneall’s mind, most evles find beauty in common things. Like tapestries, poetry or sculpturing. Many of these things his family tried to force on him. But that’s not what caught Eirneall’s eye. For Eirneall his canvas was the ground he fought on and the tip of a blade were the bristles on his brush. To him there was art in perfect formation. Ever since he was a boy he dreamed of being the best. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Eirneall’s parents refused. He tried and tried to convince them that it wasn’t dangerous (which he clearly knew was). His parents stood firm and would not support the idea of Eirneall getting trained in the art of swordplay. This set a bit of separate between him and his parents. Eirneall was determined however, to become the best swordplay fighter in the realm. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Since everyone knew that Eirneall’s parents disapproved of him wielding a sword, he knew he must sneak out far from the vision of the outpost guards. The guards shifts were at dawn and dusk. He made a habit of sneaking out early in the morning. One morning, Eirneall spotted a dwarf swinging a wood branch at a skinny tree deep in the forest. After watching him for a long time Eirneall approached with a branch of his own. This startled the dwarf as Eirneall was approaching him rather fast, as if to attack, and attacking he was. Eirneall eventually introduced himself, and the dwarf gave his name as Balfour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Many years passed and branches became swords. Eirneall and Balfour met too many times to count, their sword skill becoming impressive to say the least, particularly Eirneall. He practiced on his own time a lot more than Balfour. Eirneall acquired a few handy skills that he used on Balfour, always mocking him when they practiced. Sometimes this would get to Balfour’s head, but every time he made the first move, he seemed on the ground with a point between his nose. Balfour grew immune over time, there were only so many things Eirneall could bring up to taunt him in a fight.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As time went on Eirneall started to get hungry for more. He had talks with Balfour many times about leaving and going on an adventure. Balfour always seemed hesitant at first but became open to the idea. They finally decided to head to see the elven outpost of Avanyarci, currently under construction... </p>
