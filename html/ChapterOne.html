		<p> The adventurers found themselves caught in the middle of an assault on Avanyarci. Brought suddenly into a battle by the bombardment of catapults, they were unprepared to face both the dwarves and the elves, neither of whom recognized them as friends, and assumed them to be foes. The adventurers were quickly overcome by the dwarves and  the arrows of the elves. But, they were not killed in the attack, and woke later in a cave guarded by elves, who had apparently held off the attack by the dwarves by some miracle.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Calcior, captain of the guard in Avanyarci, was waiting to address them. He accused them of being spies for the dwarves in Avanyarci, citing reasons that were obviously either false or just completely illogical. Regardless, the accusation was made, and the adventurers were given a choice. “Turn on” the dwarves and become his spies on the dwarvish camp… Once they find it, or be executed for their “treason” against Duke Calci.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Valuing their lives, they tenuously agree to be Calcior’s spies. Upon their agreement, Calcior gives them details of what he wishes them to learn for him: First, the exact location of the camp, then details about the strength of Mab’s forces, and finally, discovering any towns that are sympathetic to Mab’s cause.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Roddy had a stroke of genius with a very reasonable request and earned the party some equipment from Calcior to assist them in their mission.Immediately after the party had been freed from their binding, shouts came from the mouth of the cave warning of the arrival of a party of dwarves. Calcior’s lieutenant instinctively bound the adventurers again and left them to be discovered by the dwarves. His plan worked perfectly, and the dwarves freed the party and welcomed them as enemies of the elves. The party chose to take their time searching the cave instead of going directly to the dwarves camp and were rewarded with some pieces of equipment and 1,000 gp to split amongst themselves.</p>
