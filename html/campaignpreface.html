		The great Dwarven city of Corachod has fallen to the Elven Baron (similar to a Caesar) Calci, after nearly two centuries of war. Calci had Corachod razed nearly to the ground, rebuilt by Dwarven slaves, and named Samot'cis. For close to 50 years, an uneasy peace (which is no peace at all) has settled on the great mountain Ts'a Cbili (or Awyr Dant in Dwarvish). This peace was to be short-lived, as is always the case when a people are defeated, but not entirely erased from existence.

		A rebellion has been stirred among the Dwarves, led by Mab Corrach, son of Tad Corrach, former (And True, if you ask any dwarf) King of Corrachod. After months of riots and other minor altercations, Calci decided to put a decisive end to this insurrection. When Calci dispatched his elite guard, known as Terori Sulis to squelch a riot and capture its instigators, the Terori Sulis brashly decided to make an example of the instigators. They captured Plentyn Corrach, mistaking him for his older brother and held an impromptu public execution. The Terori Sulis were as cruel as they were effective. An execution was no quick process. The executed would endure hours of pain under blades' edge before succumbing to merciful death. Mab witnessed this entire process exacted on his brother, knowing it was meant for him. It took every fibre of his being to resist making a futile attempt to save his brother. Instead of quelling the insurrection, this act spurned Mab into all-out war against the Elves. He began planning pointed attacks against key outposts. One such planned attack was against Avanyarci, the Elves' most invasively positioned garrison yet. Avanyarci was still under construction, and believed by Mab to be vulnerable to attack. Calci, however, had anticipated an attack against the garrison, and had secretly deployed extra troops to bolster defenses, led by a small group of his Terori Sulis.

		Knowing nothing of either man's plans, a group of adventurers happened to stop for supplies at that very outpost, on the very morning of the attack.
